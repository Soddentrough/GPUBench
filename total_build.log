  By not providing "FindHIP.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "HIP", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "HIP" with any of
  the following names:

    HIPConfig.cmake
    hip-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "HIP" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "HIP_DIR"
  to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "HIP" provides a
  separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
